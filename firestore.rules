/**
 * This ruleset enforces a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model combined with
 * user ownership. Admins are granted broad read and management privileges, while
 * regular users (customers) have restricted access to their own data.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * The security model is centered around a dedicated `/roles_admin` collection.
 * The existence of a user's UID as a document ID in this collection grants
 * them system-wide administrative privileges. All other users are treated as
 * customers with access scoped strictly to their own information.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /roles_admin/{userId}: Defines which users are administrators.
 * - /customers/{customerId}: Stores customer-specific data, owned by the customer.
 * - /bookings/{bookingId}: A central collection of all bookings. Accessible to admins
 *   and the specific customer who created the booking.
 * - /contact_form_submissions/{submissionId}: A collection for public contact
 *   form entries, readable only by admins.
